# onboarding_app
## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/jmdtc/onboarding_app.git
yarn install (should install automatically expo otherwise you need to install it globally)
yarn start
```
The mockup seemed to be for an iOS app (the date picker), but this works for both Android and iOS.

## Thoughts on the task
I had never done any React-Native, so that was fun to learn and thankfully it is quite close to React so I was not lost. I also set up the project in Typescript for later, even though I used a lot of plain javascript as React-Native was already completely new to me and I did not want to spend too much time on setup.

As for the API, the project is rather simple and straightforward as the app consisted of 5 screens, yet I tried to make it easily understandable. For the state management I used redux/toolkit because it required the less boilerplate and setup.
